# DissertationLevel
The Unreal Engine 4 level for my CSC3095 Dissertation project comparing the use of A* pathfinding for multiple single AI entities versus
the use of A* pathfinding on a single Flock of AI to move through a randomly generated environment to reach the goal.

## TODO List
- Create Single Grid map for AI's to use covering entire environment
- Ensure AI not getting stuck on world objects
- Track performance of A* (memory use/time taken)
